# XRAY Integration for Polymorphic DSL

XRAY is a Test Management System. This repository allows it to integrate with the Polymorphic DSL library.

## Development

### Generate the source code

Run `mvn antlr4:antlr4` to generate the code needed to run the tests
If you still have compilation errors in your IDE, you probably need to mark the directory ./target/generated-sources/antlr4 as a test sources root
